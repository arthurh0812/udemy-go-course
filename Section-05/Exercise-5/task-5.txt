1. at the package level scope, using the “var” keyword, create a VARIABLE with the IDENTIFIER “y”. The variable should be of the UNDERLYING TYPE of your custom TYPE assigned to “x”
eg:

2. in func main
  a) now use CONVERSION to convert the TYPE of the VALUE stored in “x” to the UNDERLYING TYPE
  b) then use the “=” operator to ASSIGN that value to “y”
  c) print out the value stored in “y”
  d) print out the type of “y”
