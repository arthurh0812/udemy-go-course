A Slice allows you to group together Values of the same Type. behind the 
scenes for a Slice that has no specified underlying Array an Array is 
created automatically. This Elements of the Array are modified whenever 
the slice's are modified, too.

Composite Literals construct Values for Structs, Arrays, Slices, and Maps 
and create a new Value each time they are evaluated. they consist of the 
Type of the Literal followed by a brace-bound list of Elements. each 
Element may optionally be preceeded by a corresponding Key.
