Slices are built on top of Arrays. a Slice is dynamic in that it will grow in size. 
The underlying Array, however, does not grow in size. When we create a slice, we can 
use the built in function make to specify how large our Slice should be and also how 
large the underlying Array should be. This can enhance performance a little bit 
because every time the size of the Slice is bigger than the size of its underlying 
Array, the items of the Array will be copied and set into another Array which then 
replaces the old unerlying Array. That takes quite a bit a time to process compared 
to having no such thing when specifically setting the size of the undelying Array 
big enough.
  - make([]T, length, capacity) 
  - make([]int, 50, 100)
