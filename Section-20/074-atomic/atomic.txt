Atomic provides a low-level atomic memory primitives useful for implementing 
synchronization algorithms.

Requires great care to be used correctly. Except for special low-level applications,
synchronization is better done with channels or the facilities of the sync package.

Share memory by communicating; don't communicate by sharing memory.
