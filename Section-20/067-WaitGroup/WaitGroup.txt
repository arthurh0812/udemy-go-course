A WaitGroup waits for a collection of goroutines to finish. The main goroutine calls
Add to set the number of goroutines to wait for. Then each of the goroutines runs
and calls Done finished. At the same time, Wait can be used to block until all 
goroutines have finished. Writing concurrent code is super easy: all we do is put 
"go" in front of a function or method call.

sync.WaitGroup
  - func (wg *WaitGroup) Add(delta int) 
  - func (wg *WaitGroup) Done() 
  - func (wg *WaitGroup) Wait()
