Channels can be thought as pipes using which Goroutines communicate.
Similar to how water flows from one end to another pipe, data can be sent from one 
end and received from another end using channels.

Sends and Receives are Blocking by default:
Sends and Receives to a channel are Blocking by default. What does this mean? When 
data is sent to a channel, the control is Blocked in the send statement until some other Goroutine reads from that channel. Similarly when data is read from a channel, 
the read is Blocked until some Goroutine writes to that channel.
