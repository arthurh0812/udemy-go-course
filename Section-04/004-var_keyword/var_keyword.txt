Scope:
  - where a variable exists and is accessible

var Keyword:
  - can be used anywhere within the package
  - variables declared by "var", which are in the Package-level code, can be accessed anywhere in the package
  - variables declared by "var", which are not in the Package-level code, follow the standard scoping rules

short declaration Operator:
  - cannot be used outside a function Body (that means in package-level code)
  - variables declared by it follow the standard scoping rules

default values:
  - if no explicit Initialization is provided when a variable is declared, the variable/value is given a default value. Each element of such variable/value is set to the "zero-value" for its individual Type:
    - bool: false
    - int: 0
    - float: 0.0
    - string: ""
    - pointer/function/interface/slice/channel/map: nil
  initialization is done recursively.

declaration + assignment to value => "initialization"
