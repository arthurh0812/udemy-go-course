1. using goroutines, create an incrementor program
  - have a variable hold the incrementor value
  - launch a bunch of goroutines
  - each goroutine should:
    ~ read the incrementor value and store it in a new variable
    ~ yield the processor with runtime.Gosched()
    ~ increment the new variable
    ~ write the value of the new variable back to the incrementor variable

2. use waitgroups to wait for all of your goroutines to finish
3. prove that it is a race condition by using the 'race' flag
