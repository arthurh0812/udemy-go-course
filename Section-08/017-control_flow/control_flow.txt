Computers read programs in a certain way, just like we read books in a certain way 
when we, as humans, read books, in western culture, we read from front to back, left 
to right, top to bottom. this is known as reading it in Sequence. this is also known
as Sequential control flow. in addition to Sequential control flow, there are two
other statements which can affect how a computer reads code. a computer might hit a 
Loop control flow. if it hits one of these, it will loop over the code in a 
specified manner. Loop control flow is also known as Iterative control flow. finally 
there is also Conditional control flow. if the computer hits a Condition like an 
"if-statement" or a "switch-statement" the computer will take some course of action 
depending upon some conditionl. so the three ways a computer reads code are:
  => Sequential
  => Iterative
  => Conditional

  a) Sequence
    - one line after another
  b) Loop / Iterative
    - "for loop"
      - init, cond, post
    - bool (while-ish)
      - infinite
    - do-while-ish
      - break
    - continue
    - nested
  c) Conditionals
    - switch / case / default statements
      - no default fall-through
      - creating fall-through
      - multiple cases
      - cases can be expressions
        ~ evaluate to true, they run
      - type
    - if statements
      - the "not operator" (!)
      - initialization statement
      - if / else
      - if / else if / else
      - if / else if / else if / else
