Pointers allow you to Share a Value stored in some memory location. use Pointers 
when:
  1. you don't want to pass around a lot of data
  2. you want to change the data at a location

Evetything in Go is Pass By Value. Pass by reference, pass by copy - that doesn't
matter in Go. "Pass by Value". That's the phrase you need to know. "What you see is 
what you get" (wysiwyg). Only Values of something are ever passed around, except you reference the address of that Value.
