Channels are like runners in a relay race
  - they are synchronized
  - they have to pass/receive the value at the same time
  - just like runners in a relay race, they have to pass/receive the baton to each 
    other at the same time
  - the value is passed/received synchronously; at the same time

Channels allow us to pass values between goroutines.
