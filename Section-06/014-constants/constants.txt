Constant:
  - simple, unchanging value
  - only exists at compile time
  - there are Typed and Untyped Constants:
    a) const hello = "Hello, World"
    b) const typedHello string = "Hello, World"
  
  - Untyped Constant:
    - a constant value that does not yet have a fixed type
      a) "constant of a kind"
      b) not yet forced to "obey" the strict rules that prevent combining differently typed values
    - an untyped constant can be implicitly converted by the compiler
  
  - it is this notion of an untyped constant that makes it possible for us to use constants in Go with great freedom
