we can create Anonymous Structs also. an Anonymous Struct is a Struct which is not 
associated with a specific Identifier. this can be useful when you only need a 
certain struct once and don't want to overcomplicate your code by declaring more and 
more Variables and Types with Identifiers. so if you need a certain combination of 
Fields of different Types only once, it is a good solution to use an Anonymous 
Struct there.
